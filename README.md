### What I learned
I didn't learn any new thing for now as this challenge was more of testing myself to see if i could apply all that i had learnt.

### Continued development

I've still not understood the concept of Media queries and a lot of people questioned why I used internal CSS instead of external. I'll like to improve on those areas.

### Useful resources

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This helped me understand a lot of terms
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - showed me better ways of applying selectors and tags
