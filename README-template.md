## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - For styles

### What I learned
I didn't learn any new thing for now as this challenge was more of testing myself to see if i could apply all that i had learnt.

### Continued development

I've still not understood the concept of Media queries. I doubt it was needed in this challenge, but i hope to work on more challenges that will make me come to understand it better.

### Useful resources

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This helped me understand a lot of terms
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - showed me better ways of applying selectors and tags
